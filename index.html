<p>I'm George, and I'm an Mammoth MVP pass holder. So, when I'm not at my desk coding, I'll be up in the slopes shredding, or in the park jibbing and hitting the jumps.</p>

<p>From time to time, I'd like a moment in the sun reading up on how to improve site performance, what's new in mobile web development, or peeking at what other talented coders are working on on github.</p>
